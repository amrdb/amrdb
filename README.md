## Hey there! I'm Amr!

### üìñ Library

- **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)**
  - I am currently reading it with [Akshat's book club](https://notes.akjn.dev/notes/ostep/).
- **Database Design & Implemenation**
  - I am currently reading it with some of the database industry experts in the [Software Internals book club](https://eatonphil.com/2024-database-design-and-implementation.html). Also, I am implementing tasks in [SimpleDB](https://github.com/amrelmohamady/simpledb) educational database in Java.
- **Learning Go**
  - I am almost done with it and I think I am in love with Go!
- **Node.js Design Patterns**
  - A Node.js book about design patterns, writing modules, asynchronous programming, Scalability, Architectural Patterns &     Advanced Node.js topics. I read ths book when I was starting out my backend development learning journey. IMO, this is the goto source to learn Node.js and gain practical knowledge.
- **System Design Interview**
  - A book about system design in which the writers show a process of designing many systems at large scale. I actually used some of the concepts and architectural decisions mentioned in the book in my backend internship. 
- **Database Internals: A Deep Dive into How Distributed Data Systems Work**
  - The first half of the book explores storage classification, and dive into B-Tree-based and immutable Log Structured storage engines. It explains how database files are organized to build efficient storage, using auxiliary data structures such as Page Cache, Buffer Pool and Write-Ahead Log. The book covers implementations of different techniques and optimizations used in real database systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL & Apache Cassandra. I only read the first half since the second half explores distributed databases which I will read after studying distributed systems. I read it with a private book club consisting of expert software engineers and architects. We grouped together every week over a zoom call to discuss book chapters.
- **Fundamentals of Database Systems**
  - I used this database textbook to study relational database theory while studying the Datbase Modeling & Theory course from Stanford University.
