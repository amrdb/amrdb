## Hey there! I'm Amr and I am looking for a software engineering internship!

### üìñ Library

- **Database Design & Implemenation**
  - I am currently reading it and implementing tasks in [SimpleDB](https://github.com/amrelmohamady/simpledb) educational database in Java.
- **Learning Go**
  - I am currently reading it while learning Go!
- **Node.js Design Patterns**
  - A Node.js book about design patterns, writing modules, asynchronous programming, Scalability, Architectural Patterns &     Advanced Node.js topics.
- **System Design Interview**
  - A book about system design in which writers show a process of designing many systems at large scale.
- **Database Internals: A Deep Dive into How Distributed Data Systems Work**
  - The first half of the book explores storage classification, and dive into B-Tree-based and immutable Log Structured storage engines. It explains how database files are organized to build efficient storage, using auxiliary data structures such as Page Cache, Buffer Pool and Write-Ahead Log. The book covers implementations of different techniques and optimizations used in real database systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL & Apache Cassandra. I only read the first half since the second half explores distributed databases which I will read after studying distributed systems.
- **Fundamentals of Database Systems**
  - I used this database textbook to study Database design & normalization while studying the Datbase Modeling & Theory course from Stanford University.
